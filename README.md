# Trial Monitor

Trial Monitor is a tool that enables developers and researchers to create personalized web dashboards for monitoring participants in technology-enabled field trials. The tool was designed to reduce the work of developing oneâ€™s own dashboard, the need to adapt the technology stack to an existing dashboard, or the need to create a different dashboard tool for each project.

Trial Monitor uses simple configuration files to define the connection to different databases, the types of visualizations to be used, and the user interface that researchers will see to make sense of the user-generated data.

## Requirements

Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (tested with v16)  or Docker installed on your machine according to your desired set up.


## Getting Started

Trial Monitor can either be installed directly on your machine or use through Docker. In the repository, we provide a config with examples and sample data, as well as Docker files and Docker images for easy deployment.

You can use the published docker images to run Trial Monitor without clonning the repository. To do so, follow these instructions:

1. Download the [config.template](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/trial-monitor/tree/master/config.template) folder.

2. Rename `config.template` to `config`.

3. Edit the files in the `config` folder according to the needs of your project. Don't forget to specify the location where the API will run in `api_url` within the `ui-config.json` file.

4. Run the services using docker or docker-compose. Make sure you map the `config` folder as a volumes as shown in the following example:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  api:
    image: ghcr.io/fraunhoferportugal/trialmonitor-api:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config:/usr/config
    ports:
      - 3001:80
  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/fraunhoferportugal/trialmonitor-ui:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config/ui-config.json:/usr/share/nginx/html/ui-config.json
    ports:
      - 80:80
```

For this example, the `api_url` within the `ui-config.json` file needs to be `"http://host.docker.internal:3001/api"` (verify if it is correctly configured, more information [here](https://fraunhoferportugal.github.io/trial-monitor/Getting%20started/deployment#requirement-docker-configuration-requirement)) or `"http://<domain_name>:3001/api"`.

> :page_facing_up: Check [here](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/trial-monitor/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) for a more complex example of a docker-compose file. Don't forget to replace `build` property from `api` and `frontend` services with the respective docker images.

For more details refer to the [Trial Monitor Documentation](https://fraunhoferportugal.github.io/trial-monitor/). You can also run the documentation on your machine by following the instructions [here](./docs/README.md).

## Building from Source

To install Trial Monitor  on your machine from the source repository follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository on your machine.

````
git clone https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/trial-monitor.git
````

2. Rename `config.template` to `config`.

3. Edit the files in the `config` folder according to the needs of your project.

For more details, see the [documentation](https://fraunhoferportugal.github.io/trial-monitor/). You can also run the documentation on your machine by following the instructions [here](./docs/README.md).

### Running Trial Monitor

To use Trial Monitor directly on your machine with `yarn` just run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

Or you can use the `docker-compose` file:

```bash
# Production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up

# Development
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

> :warning: When running with docker in development, you shouldn't install the packages using yarn in your host. The startup script will install the packages for you. If you did, delete the directories: packages/client/node_modules and packages/server/node_modules.

In development mode, Trial Monitor API will run by default on port `3001`, while the UI will run by default on port `8080`. When running in development mode all changes in the config files will be automatically reflected on the interface.

> :page_facing_up: To run Trial Monitor with authentication check the instructions [here](https://fraunhoferportugal.github.io/trial-monitor/Getting%20started/deployment).
